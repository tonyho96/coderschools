But a developer can quickly perceive a new one if needed. The reason is there are common elements that present in every programming language (the five elements we cover in the lecture is a good example). And beyond that, programming is basically not about the syntax or code. It's about how to solve the problem with a combination of the key elements like the loop, if-condition, variables, etc. It requires logical thinking, creativity and since your code can grow pretty quick, it should be well-organized as well.\n","\n","With that in mind now you can tell the best learning strategy is\n","* Understand the key elements deeply\n","* Solve simple problems with simple combinations\n","* When you can build a solution inside your head right after looking at a simple problem, move on to the next level.\n","* Practice, practice, and practice\n","\n","Have fun and always be learning!\n","\n"]},{"metadata":{"id":"9jdmO3L80hN8","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Find the biggest and smallest number"]},{"metadata":{"id":"1bAwBgLKk_2P","colab_type":"code","outputId":"234e89b1-b5e6-431c-e172-1a72e70d5636","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1556513581779,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":1024,"user":{"displayName":"Hai Minh Do","photoUrl":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZUlR9wP4IpA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/F2ZaIjf8WSY/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"12822549848477954436"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":69}},"cell_type":"code","source":["# Write a function to find smallest and biggest number out of given 3 numbers.\n","# Use if-statement only to solve this.\n","# Example: a=4, b=18, c=2 -> return 2\n","\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","a = np.random.randint(100)\n","b = np.random.randint(100)\n","c = np.random.randint(100)\n","\n","print(a, b, c)\n","\n","def smallest(a, b, c):\n","  # Your code here\n","  return 0\n","\n","def largest(a, b, c):\n","  # Your code here\n","  return 0\n","\n","\n","print('The smallest of the 3 numbers is: ', smallest(a, b, c))\n","print('The smallest of the 3 numbers is: ', largest(a, b, c))\n","\n"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["77 94 46\n","The smallest of the 3 numbers is:  0\n","The smallest of the 3 numbers is:  0\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"id":"U3VhSDiF1UxT","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Sum of numbers between a and b"]},{"metadata":{"id":"xw0qu3Vs0fv3","colab_type":"code","outputId":"e1995f06-33c2-4fc7-f64d-096f9be8489e","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1556110584112,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":782,"user":{"displayName":"Hai Minh Do","photoUrl":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZUlR9wP4IpA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/F2ZaIjf8WSY/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"12822549848477954436"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":52}},"cell_type":"code","source":["# Given two integers a and b (a ≤ b).

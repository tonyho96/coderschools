The reason is there are common elements that present in every programming language (the five elements we cover in the lecture is a good example). And beyond that, programming is basically not about the syntax or code. It's about how to solve the problem with a combination of the key elements like the loop, if-condition, variables, etc. It requires logical thinking, creativity and since your code can grow pretty quick, it should be well-organized as well.\n","\n","With that in mind now you can tell the best learning strategy is\n","* Understand the key elements deeply\n","* Solve simple problems with simple combinations\n","* When you can build a solution inside your head right after looking at a simple problem, move on to the next level.\n","* Practice, practice, and practice\n","\n","Have fun and always be learning!\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9jdmO3L80hN8","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Find the biggest and smallest number"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"1bAwBgLKk_2P","colab_type":"code","outputId":"1a651cc5-9bc1-4e43-c11a-680bd5c3fe32","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1556110442922,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":1184,"user":{"displayName":"Hai Minh Do","photoUrl":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZUlR9wP4IpA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/F2ZaIjf8WSY/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"12822549848477954436"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":69}},"source":["# Write a function to find smallest and biggest number out of given 3 numbers.\n","# Use if-statement only to solve this.\n","# Example: a=4, b=18, c=2 -> return 2\n","\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","a = np.random.randint(100)\n","b = np.random.randint(100)\n","c = np.random.randint(100)\n","\n","print(a, b, c)\n","\n","def smallest(a, b, c):\n","  # Your code here\n","  if (a < b) and (a < c):\n","    return a\n","  else:\n","    if (b < c) and (b < a):\n","      return b\n","    else:\n","      return c\n","\n","def largest(a, b, c):\n","  # Your code here\n","  if (a > b) and (a > c):\n","    return a\n","  else:\n","    if (b > c) and (b > a):\n","      return b\n","    else:\n","      return c\n","\n","\n","print('The smallest of the 3 numbers is: ', smallest(a, b, c))\n","print('The smallest of the 3 numbers is: ', largest(a, b, c))\n","\n"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["65 33 72\n","The smallest of the 3 numbers is:  33\n","The smallest of the 3 numbers is:  72\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"U3VhSDiF1UxT","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Sum of numbers between a and b"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"xw0qu3Vs0fv3","colab_type":"code","outputId":"e1995f06-33c2-4fc7-f64d-096f9be8489e","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1556110584112,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":782,"user":{"displayName":"Hai Minh Do","photoUrl":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZUlR9wP4IpA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/F2ZaIjf8WSY/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"12822549848477954436"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":52}},"source":["# Given two integers a and b (a ≤ b).

been working with a single table, but entity data in the real world is often broken down into pieces and stored across multiple tables.\n","\n","Tables that share information about a single entity need to have a **primary key** that identifies that entity **uniquely** across the database. One common primary key type is an auto-incrementing integer (because they are space efficient), but it can also be a string, hashed value, so long as it is unique.\n","\n","Using the **JOIN** clause in a query, we can combine row data across two separate tables using this unique key. The first of the joins that we will introduce is the **INNER JOIN**.\n","\n","The **INNER JOIN** is a process that matches rows from the first table and the second table which have the same key (as defined by the **ON** constraint) to create a result row with the combined columns from both tables.\n","\n","```\n","SELECT column, another_table_column, …\n","FROM mytable\n","INNER JOIN

the use of aggregate expressions (or functions) that allow you to summarize information about a group of rows of data.\n","\n","Common aggregate functions:\n","\n","| Functions | Description |\n","|:-:|:-:|\n","|**COUNT**(*), **COUNT**(column) | A common function used to counts the number of rows in the group if no column name is specified. Otherwise, count the number of rows in the group with non-NULL values in the specified column.|\n","|**MIN**(column) | Finds the smallest numerical value in the specified column for all rows in the group.|\n","|**MAX**(column) | Finds the largest numerical value in the specified column for all rows in the group.|\n","|**AVG**(column) | Finds the average numerical value in the specified column for all rows in the group.|\n","|**SUM**(column) | Finds the sum of all numerical values in the specified column for the rows in the group.|\n","\n","More docs: [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/lang_aggfunc.html), [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/group-by-functions.html), [Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/functions-aggregate.html)\n","\n","In addition to aggregating across all the rows, you can instead apply the aggregate functions to individual groups of data within that group. This would then create as many results as there are unique groups defined as by the  **GROUP BY** clause.\n","\n","```\n","SELECT AGG_FUNC(column_or_expression) AS aggregate_description, …\n","FROM mytable\n","WHERE constraint_expression\n","GROUP BY column;\n","```\n","\n","Our queries are getting fairly complex, but we have nearly introduced all the important parts of a  **SELECT** query. One thing that you might have noticed is that if the **GROUP BY** clause is executed after the **WHERE** clause (which filters the rows which are to be grouped), then how exactly do we filter the grouped rows?\n","\n","Luckily, SQL allows us to do this by adding an additional **HAVING** clause which is used specifically with the **GROUP BY** clause to allow us to filter grouped rows from the result set.\n","\n","```\n","SELECT group_by_column, AGG_FUNC(column_expression) AS aggregate_result_alias, …\n","FROM mytable\n","WHERE condition\n","GROUP BY column\n","HAVING
